Classical Electrodynamics is one of the central subjects a physics student encounters in their study. It is also considered by many to be a difficult subject to master. The subject presents many difficulties, conceptual and mathematical. I did not like the way I was taught the subject and I have wondered since some time whether there is a better way of doing things. In this blog post, and in a series of blog posts following this one, I will present a view of Electrodynamics education that I feel is more satisfying than the traditional one. I have upper level undergraduate/beginning graduate students in mind in this post. Introductory Electrodynamics is a completely different challenge altogether.

Generally Classical Electrodynamics is taught in a pseudo-historical way. The course starts with Coulomb's law, spending a significant amount of time studying Gauss's Law, Poisson Equation and various mathematical methods associated with solving PDEs. Then we study Magnetostatics, studying Ampere's Law, Circulation Theorem and it's associated mathematics. A great deal of attention is then paid to 'unification' of Electricity and Magnetism.
