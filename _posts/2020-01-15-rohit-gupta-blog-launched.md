This is my attempt at creating a blog post. I promise the future blogs will have actual content. For now I want to plug [this wonderful post](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) whose template I am following to create my own website.
I cannot recommend this enough. Hopefully you will find this post useful if you are trying to create your own personal website. This blog is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use markdown to author posts.
